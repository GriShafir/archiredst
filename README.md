# What is ArchiRedst?
ArchiRedst is a Minecraft map, where most of the buildings from Guide to Creative (2017) and Guide to Redstone (2017) and with some building from the internet.

# Why is "ArchiRedst"?
I picked that name because of how "not bad" this name sounds in comparison to "CreatRedst" or something like that (right?). Also, I have these books in Ukrainian and while I smart enough to translate "red stone" ("червоний камень" on Ukrainian) to "redstone", I didn't even think about translating "architector" to "creative".
